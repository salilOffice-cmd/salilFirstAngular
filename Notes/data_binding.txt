In Angular, string interpolation and property binding are both ways
 to pass data from the component class to the template.


String Interpolation:
String interpolation is denoted by double curly braces {{ }}.
It allows you to display the component's property values within the HTML template.
The expression inside the double curly braces is evaluated and the
result is converted to a string and displayed in the HTML.



Property Binding:
Property binding is denoted by square brackets [ ].
It allows you to set the value of an HTML element property to
the value of a component's property.


NOTE::
In summary, string interpolation is used to display the component's property
values within the HTML template, while property binding 
is used to set the value of an HTML element property to the value 
of a component's property.


Which to use when:
1. Property binding is more explicit and is the recommended way
to bind properties in Angular. 
It makes it clear that you are binding to a property of the element.
**Property binding is necessary when you want to bind 
to a property that is not a string**. 
For example, if you want to bind to a boolean property, 
you would need to use property binding like this: <input [disabled]="isDisabled" />.
